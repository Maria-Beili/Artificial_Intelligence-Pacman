    Question 1 (3 points): Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search

        This DFS implementation explores the deepest nodes in the search tree first. 
        It maintains the necessary information to reconstruct the path from the start state to the goal state using a search node class. 
        Each node contains the current state, the action taken to reach it, and the cost of reaching it from the start state. 
        The algorithm utilizes a stack to manage the frontier, adding successors of each node until the goal state is found or all nodes are explored. 
        It returns a list of valid actions to move Pacman from the start state to the goal state, not considering the cost neither the efficiency of the path.

    Question 4 (3 points): A* search
        The frontier is initialized as a priority queue, starting with the initial state.
        The algorithm explores nodes until it finds the goal, calculating the combined cost f(n) for each node.
        Successor nodes are added to the frontier with priorities calculated using the cost to reach them (g(n)) and the heuristic function's estimate (h(n)).
        The algorithm returns the optimal path once it reaches the goal.
        A* finds the optimal path to the goal by expanding fewer nodes than UCS, since the heuristic guides the algorithm to the goal more directly.
        UCS tends to expand more nodes because it simply looks at the cumulative cost without having a clear direction of where to go.
